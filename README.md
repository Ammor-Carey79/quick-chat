# Quick Chat - Realtime Chat Application

Quick Chat is a realtime chat application designed to provide seamless and instant communication. This project includes both a client-side frontend and a server-side backend to deliver a complete chat experience.

## Features
- Real-time messaging
- Scalable architecture for multiple users
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Easy setup for development

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Setup Instructions
To get started with the Quick Chat application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/quick-chat.git
   cd quick-chat
   ```

2. Install dependencies and start the development servers for both the client and server:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
